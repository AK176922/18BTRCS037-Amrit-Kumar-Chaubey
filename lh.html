  <p>
    The Hurac치n made its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show, and was released in the market in the second quarter of 2014. The LP 610-4 designation comes from the car having a 610 metric horsepower and 4 wheel drive, while LP stands for
    "Longitudinale Posteriore", which refers to the longitudinal mid-rear engine position.The main competitors of the Hurac치n include the McLaren 650S (as well as the 720S), the Audi R8, the Ferrari 458 Speciale and the 488 GTB. Extra options that
    increase the price of the car include interior enhancements, special paint schemes, improved suspension, and a lifting system, as well as multiple components optionally available in carbon fibre, rather than aluminium.Taiwan models went on sale
    for NT$15,080,000.

  <h2>Engine</h2>
  <p>
    The Hurac치n maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine from the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine
    has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Hurac치n's engine also includes a
    start-stop system.
