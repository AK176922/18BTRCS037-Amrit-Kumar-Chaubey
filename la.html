  <h3>Aventsder SVJ</h3>
  <p>
    The Lamborghini Aventador makes one believe that statement. With the finite time we have on this planet,
    some humans dedicate themselves to building creations that, though unobtainable to the majority, inspire and excite beyond what we ever thought possible. Lamborghini has been the masters of concentrating human creativity and ingenuity into
    creations that garner such attention, that it borders on cultic religions. The Aventador SVJ is one such creation. With a reworked version of Lamborghini's new V12 under the hood, active aero and enough carbon-fiber to build something big out of
    carbon-fiber, the SVJ represents the pinnacle of hypercar engineering, and it has clearly paid off: the SVJ is the current fastest production car ever to lap the Nurburgring. With only 900 units ever put on sale, you can forget about buying a new
    one, and if you want to know for how much, then just keep on walking, buddy.
